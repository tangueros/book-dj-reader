# So you want to be a DJ

Congratulations.  A DJ is the main conduit for the dissemination of tango music in today's world -- more important than radio, TV, film or the Internet.  A DJ is tastemaker who shapes the budding palette of a community.  He influences, through his curation, the kind of ambience and feelings attached to the term "tango".  He defines the meaning of tango.
